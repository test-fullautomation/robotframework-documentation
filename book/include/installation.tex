\chapter{Installation and start}

The \textbf{RobotFramework AIO} can be installed under Windows and under Linux in this way:

\begin{itemize}
   \item \textbf{Win10}

         Double-click the \plog{setup\_.*.exe} file and follow the instructions.

   \item \textbf{Linux}

         If already installed, remove the previous version (this will not remove your own data):

         \begin{pythonlog}
sudo apt-get remove robotframework-aio
\end{pythonlog}

         Install/Update now the current version (assumed you are in the download directory):
         \begin{pythonlog}
sudo apt-get install ./setup_RobotFramework_AIO_OSD6Linux\_*.deb
\end{pythonlog}

\end{itemize}

After the installation is finished, a new \textbf{VSCodium} icon is present on desktop:
\begin{itemize}
   \item \textbf{Win10}

         \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{./include/graphics/installation/Icon_Win10.png}
         (together with a link to the example robot file \plog{HelloWorld.robot})

   \item \textbf{Linux}

         \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{./include/graphics/installation/Icon_Linux.png}
\end{itemize}

A double-click starts the application.

\newpage

On first start the \textbf{VSCodium} main window appears like this:

The preconfigured workspace contains the following parts:

\begin{itemize}
   \item The main documentation \plog{RobotFrameworkAIO_Reference.pdf} (including the documentation of all components that are part of the \textbf{RobotFramework AIO})
   \item A \plog{testcases} folder containing (beneath other elements) the  example robot file \plog{HelloWorld.robot}
   \item A \plog{logfiles} folder in which all log files and reports will be placed (from tests that are executed with \textbf{VSCodium})
   \item A \plog{tutorial} folder containing a large bunch of testfiles that can be used for self-dependent learning
\end{itemize}

\newpage

For the usage of the predefined infrastructure (e.g. the \plog{logfiles} folder), the \textbf{VSCodium} provides an adapted configuration of the \textbf{Run} button.
This button executes the robot file selected in project explorer of \textbf{VSCodium}.

After test execution, the links to log files and reports can be found in the \textbf{TERMINAL} window.

Every file there can be opened by CTRL+click on the selected file.
