\chapter{\rfw\ environment}

During an installation of the \rfw\ all content is placed at two different main locations:

\begin{itemize}
   \item \rlog{RobotFramework}\\
         Contains the framework installation files itself
   \item \rlog{RobotTest}\\
         Contains the \textit{playground} for the user, including default folder for testcases and logfiles
\end{itemize}

The root path to these folders can be set by the user during the installation process (called \rlog{<root>} in listings below).

The following overview contains a list of environment variables that are introduced by the installer. They can be used
to refer to locations inside these folders.

\begin{itemize}
   \item \rcode{RobotLogPath}\\
         Log files folder in which the \rfw\ places the log files per default.\\
         Location: \rlog{<root>/RobotTest/logfiles}

   \item \rcode{RobotTestPath}\\
         Folder in which the user can place the testcases.\\
         Location: \rlog{<root>/RobotTest/testcases}

   \item \rcode{RobotTutorialPath}\\
         Folder containing a tutorial of the \rfw\ (useful for self learning).\\
         Location: \rlog{<root>/RobotTest/tutorial}

   \item \rcode{RobotPythonPath}\\
         Folder containing the Python installation.\\
         Location: \rlog{<root>/RobotFramework/python39}

   \item \rcode{RobotScriptPath}\\
         Folder containing scripts of the Python installation.\\
         Location: \rlog{<root>/RobotFramework/python39/scripts}

   \item \rcode{RobotVsCode}\\
         Folder containing the installation of \textit{Visual Studio Code} that is intended
         to be the main development environment for the \rfw.\\
         Location: \rlog{<root>/RobotFramework/robotvscode}

   \item \rcode{RobotToolsPath}\\
         Tools which require and extend functionality of the \rfwcore.\\
         Location: \rlog{<root>/RobotFramework/tools}

   \item \rcode{RobotDevtools}\\
         Tools which are independent of \rfwcore, but are bundeled and tested with \rfw.
         Location: \rlog{<root>/RobotFramework/devtools}

   \item \rcode{RobotAppium}\\
         Location of Appium tested and distributed with \rfw. More information about Appium you find here:
         \href{https://appium.io/}{appium}\\
         Location: \rlog{<root>/RobotFramework/devtools/Windows/Appium}

   \item \rcode{RobotNodeJS}\\
         Root folder of \rlog{nodjs} tested and distributed with \rfw. More information about \rlog{nodjs} you you find here:
         \href{https://nodejs.org/en/}{nodejs.org}\\
         Location: \rlog{<root>/RobotFramework/devtools/Windows/nodejs}

\end{itemize}
