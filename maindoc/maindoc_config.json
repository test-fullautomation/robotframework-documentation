# Section "CONTROL":
# ------------------
# Contains parameter to control the application behavior in general.

                # If 'STRICT' is true: missing LaTeX compiler causes an error; otherwise PDF generation is handled as option

# Section "IMPORTS":
# ------------------
# Within the folders listed below, the documentation rendering process (GenPackageDoc) is executed.
# The generated PDF files will be part of the main documentation.

   "IMPORTS" : ["../../python-genpackagedoc",
                "../../python-extensions-collection",
                "../../robotframework-extensions-collection",

# Section "OUTPUT":
# -----------------
# Defines the path to the output folder containing the generated PDF files and the tex file to import these PDF files
# into the main documentation.

   "OUTPUT" : "../docbuild",


# Section "BOOKSOURCES":
# ----------------------
# Defines the path to the folder containing the manually maintained tex files if the RobotFrameworkAIO reference
# It is expected that within this folder a file with name "MAINTEXFILENAME" is present.

   "BOOKSOURCES" : "../book",


# Section "MAINTEXFILENAME":
# ----------------------
# Defines the name of the main tex file, that has to be executed by the LaTeX compiler.
# It is expected that this file is present within "BOOKSOURCES".

   "MAINTEXFILENAME" : "RobotFrameworkAIO_Reference.tex",


# Section "TEX":
# -----------------
# Converting the generated text source files to a PDF document requires a LaTeX distribution.
# GenPackageDoc needs to know where to find LaTeX. Because the path to the LaTeX interpreter depends
# on the operating system, this path has to be defined separately for every supported operating system
# (currently "WINDOWS" and "LINUX").
# Example:

   "TEX" : {
            "WINDOWS" : "%ROBOTLATEXPATH%/miktex/bin/x64/pdflatex.exe",
            "LINUX"   : "${ROBOTLATEXPATH}/miktex/bin/x64/pdflatex"
           }
}
