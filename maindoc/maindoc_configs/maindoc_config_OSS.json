# Section "IMPORTS":
# ------------------
# Within the folders listed below, the documentation rendering process (GenPackageDoc) is executed.
# The generated PDF files will be part of the main documentation.

# Section "BOOKSOURCES":
# ----------------------
# Defines the path to the folder containing the manually maintained tex files of the RobotFramework AIO reference.
# It is expected that within this folder a file with name "MAINTEXFILENAME" is present.
# This folder is also used as output folder for the generated PDF files.

# Section "MAINTEXFILENAME":
# --------------------------
# Defines the name of the main tex file, that has to be executed by the LaTeX compiler.
# It is expected that this file is present within "BOOKSOURCES".

# Section "JOBNAME":
# ------------------
# Defines the name of the pdflatex job.
# The pdflatex job name is the name of all pdflatex output files - but without the extension of the respective output file.
# Example: The name of the PDF file is: <JOBNAME>.pdf.
# All pdflatex output files are generated within "BOOKSOURCES".

# ---------------------------
# Any string that is added to the cover sheet of the resulting PDF (optional).

# Section "PROXY":
# ----------------
# Installation hints provided within the documentation, may require a proxy address. In case of a concrete proxy address is not known,
# (because a proxy is company specific) a replacement string has to be defined here:

   "PROXY" : "<<proxy address>>",


# Section "TEX":
# --------------
# Converting the generated text source files to a PDF document requires a LaTeX distribution.
# GenPackageDoc needs to know where to find LaTeX. Because the path to the LaTeX interpreter depends
# on the operating system, this path has to be defined separately for every supported operating system
# (currently "WINDOWS" and "LINUX").
# Example:

   "TEX" : {
            "WINDOWS" : "%GENDOC_LATEXPATH%/pdflatex.exe",
            "LINUX"   : "${GENDOC_LATEXPATH}/pdflatex"
           }
}
