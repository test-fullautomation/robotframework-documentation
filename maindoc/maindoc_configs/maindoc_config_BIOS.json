# Section "TEX":
# --------------
# Converting the generated text source files to a PDF document requires a LaTeX distribution.
# GenPackageDoc needs to know where to find LaTeX. Because the path to the LaTeX interpreter depends
# on the operating system, this path has to be defined separately for every supported operating system
# (currently "WINDOWS" and "LINUX").
# Example:

   "TEX" : {
            "WINDOWS" : "%GENDOC_LATEXPATH%/pdflatex.exe",
            "LINUX"   : "${GENDOC_LATEXPATH}/pdflatex"
           }
